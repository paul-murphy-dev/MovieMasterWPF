# MovieMasterWPF
An application that reads movie files and obtains metadata about the movies from themobiedb.org.

I created this application to teach myself WPF.

Things that might be interesting about this project:

* uses datasets as local database
* implements user selectable themes
* making web service calls asyncronously
* updating the UI asynchronously
